# Characterize Cerebral Visual Impairment via Eye-tracking using Parametric CTMC

## Installation

We recommend using a conda environment with ``Python >= 3.9`` :
```
conda create -n cvi python=3.9
conda activate cvi
```
Clone the repository and install the dependencies:
```
git clone https://github.com/Hong7Cong/EyeTrackingasMC.git
cd EyeTrackingasMC && pip install -r requirements.txt
```

We do not provide `.asc` files as well as pretrained ctmc models or image stimuli. If you have access to the data, modify the respective path parameters at `utils.py`.
